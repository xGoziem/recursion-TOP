# recursion-TOP

A repository to practice recursion and solve two recursion problems ([Fibonacci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) and [Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)) from The Odin Project's [recursion lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion). Written in Typecript.

## The Fibonacci Sequence

This solution includes two functions that take a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence. The first function does the job iteratively while the second does it recursively.

## Merge Sort

This solution includes a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a sorted array. It does this using recursion.

## How to try out the solution

Open the terminal and enter `node [path-to-generated-js-file]`. For example, enter `node dist/fibonacci/fibonacci.js` to check the solution to the fibonacci sequence problem.
